# Irla AI

**Software that sparks joy. Tools that feel human.**

At **Irla AI**, we craft software that simplifies everyday life and makes technology feel approachable, useful, and even a little delightful.

From intuitive learning tools like **Aivana**, our AI tutor empowering Nigerian students to master O‑level exams (with plans to expand across West Africa), to apps that make creativity and productivity feel effortless, we build products people genuinely enjoy using.

Founded by passionate builders who believe technology should *delight without complication*, we’re just getting started.
